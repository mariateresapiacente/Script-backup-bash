# Script-backup-bash
This Bash script automates log file backups. It creates a backup directory, iterates through all .log files in the source folder, copies them with a timestamp suffix (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS), and compresses each file using gzip. The script includes error handling and provides feedback messages for each operation, ensuring organized versioned backups.
